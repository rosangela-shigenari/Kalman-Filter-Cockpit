# Kalman Filter Cockpit

Cockipit application developed in Python to monitoring Serial Data from Arduino Connected with SparkFun LSM9DS1 and GPS NEO-6M. Serial data contains: Complementary filter resulted from Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer; GPS Data converted to X-axis and Y-axis relative of vehicle initial position; Kalman Filter response with X-axis and Y-axis relative of vehicle initial position;
